This is a small JavaScript webapp that automatically switches to Twitch stream/video when the radio channel you are listening to is playing music. This way one can listen to the nice hosts without having to listen the channel's repeititive song lists.

Currently this is only a POC.
This is not foolproof since the now playing data is updated a bit erratically sometimes.
Also this does not separate hosts from advertisements which is a downside.

## Dependencies
